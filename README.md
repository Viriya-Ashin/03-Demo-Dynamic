If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some other third-party APIs you could make `fetch()` requests to?

We can use `fetch()` to request data from various third-party APIs, such as:

- **Weather APIs**: OpenWeatherMap
- **Geolocation APIs**: Google Maps
- **Social Media APIs**: Twitter, Facebook
- **Financial APIs**: Alpha Vantage
- **News APIs**: NewsAPI
- **E-commerce APIs**: Stripe
- **Entertainment APIs**: TMDb, Spotify

These APIs provide data for weather, locations, social media, finance, news, payments, and entertainment, which you can integrate into your applications.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
